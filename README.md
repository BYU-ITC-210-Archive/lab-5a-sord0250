This was a complex project that ended up not deploying to live servers in the end. However, this was a problem that most students in the BYU ITC210 class ran into, and TA's didn't know how to fix. The vue_project folder contains the code I worked on and changed. It taught me about API's, HTML, CSS, Javascript, javascript frameworks (specifically VUE), PHP, AWS, and web development and security principles.
